1.props
    used to pass in data from outer component to
    inner component
2. events   
    something like eventlistener
    if any function occurs prior to an event , add arrow function
    so that it doesnt invoke automatically
3. state
    value of a variable updates synchronously with UI
    useState
    setName
    you can pass states as props too
4. removing a component based on a state
    return components with the condition that their "tweet"
    !== a specific tweet
5. UUID
    when both tweets have same message, the two tweets will be 
    deleted together
    Solution: 1. npm install uuid
              2. import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid"; 
                 at the place where a tweet is created
              3. incorporate id and messages as objects 
                within array
             4. filter tweets and delete them based on uuid
6. CSS
    create a new css file
    import "./style/app.css"; into app.js
7. useEffect
    a) auto runs a function everytime a component is rendered
       provided that the second parameter is an empty array
        EX: useEffect(func, [])
    b) runs a function everytime a state changes
        provided that the state is passed in as the second parameter
        (enclosed in array [] symbols)
        EX: Synchronously updates search items on search bar
             everytime a letter is typed
