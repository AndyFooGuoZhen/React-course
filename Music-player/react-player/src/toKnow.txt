Ref
Reference

when we want to select a html tag , but we can't do so using a document selector
EX: creating a function on top of a return JSAX function

import { useRef } from "react";
const audioRef = useRef(null);

In JSAX,
<audio ref={audioRef} src={currentSong.audio}></audio>

null is starting value, something similar to useState
